# Weather App
Private project, borrowed idea & design from Technigo.

## Project: 
I built a web app with Weather forecast for the users current location for current day and 7 days forward.

This is my first project fetching a third party API. I used the GEO location API to collect the users location, the Open Weather API to collect the forecast and LocationIQ API to make a reverse geocoding to get the location city name.

## Tech used: 
HTML, CSS, Javascript & Bootstrap library.
